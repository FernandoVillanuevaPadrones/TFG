Development of a Virtual Reality First Person Shooter Game with Procedural Map Generation as a Final Degree Project.

Hi! If you are interested in trying out the game here is the link for the apk: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ItofvMJsgVypEZmznf2KWTxBao7sxnxX/view?usp=sharing

If you do not know how to install an apk in your Oculus Quest or another VR device I encourage you to search for a video on Youtube because it will be easier than explaining
it here.
Hope you enjoy the game!
